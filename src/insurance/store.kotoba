  actor (itonami actor pattern, ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section; README's 'Robotics premise' — a document-handling and
  policy-binder robot performs policy printing, binder assembly and
  physical archival under this advisor/governor pair, which never
  dispatches hardware itself and never binds a policy above a
  client's registered coverage-limit ceiling). Modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-4311's bookkeeping.store.

  Domain:

    client      — a registered individual/small-business applicant
                  (:client-id, :name)
    application — a registered insurance application {:application-id
                  :client-id :name :max-coverage-limit number
                  :risk-disclosure-attached? boolean}.
                  `:max-coverage-limit` is the registered coverage
                  ceiling a proposed policy binding's coverage amount
                  must not exceed — binding coverage beyond the
                  client's registered ceiling is unauthorized
                  underwriting, not generous coverage.
                  `:risk-disclosure-attached?` records whether a risk
                  disclosure has been attached — binding a policy
                  without an attached risk disclosure is undisclosed
                  coverage, not efficient service.
    record      — a committed operating record (a bound policy) —
                  written ONLY via commit-record!.
    ledger      — append-only audit trail, commit or hold."
