  "Insurance Advisor — the advisor named in this repository's README,
  proposing an insurance-brokerage operation (bind a policy, approve
  an over-limit binding, approve a claims settlement) from a client
  application, risk profile and coverage request. Swappable mock/llm;
  the advisor ONLY proposes — `insurance.governor` checks the
  coverage-limit ceiling and risk-disclosure attachment independently
  and always escalates over-limit-binding and claims-settlement
  decisions. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-4311's advisor.

  A proposal: {:op :approve-policy-binding|:approve-over-limit-binding|:approve-claims-settlement
               :effect :propose :application-id str :coverage-amount
               number :stake kw :confidence n :rationale str}. The
  risk-disclosure-attachment state lives on the registered application
  record itself (see `insurance.store`), not on the proposal.")
